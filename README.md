# System Analysis and Design - Data Flow Diagram

This repository contains the deliverables for **System Analysis and Design Assignment 1**, focusing on creating and analyzing a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for a system. These solutions are part of a university assignment focused on applying fundamental **Systems Analysis** and Design concepts.

## Overview
The project involves the application of system analysis techniques to design a DFD that represents the processes, data stores, and data flows of a given system. The assignment also includes a comprehensive written report and diagram visualizations.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate understanding of DFD concepts.
- Develop a clear and accurate DFD for the assigned system.
- Document the analysis process and findings in a report.

## Tools Used
- **Draw.io**: For creating the DFD diagrams.
- **Microsoft Word**: For the written report.
- **Visual Paradigm**: For detailed diagram modeling.
