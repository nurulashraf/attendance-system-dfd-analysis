# System Analysis and Design - Data Flow Diagram

This repository contains the deliverables for **System Analysis and Design Assignment 1**, focusing on creating and analyzing a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for a system.

## Overview
The project involves the application of system analysis techniques to design a DFD that represents the processes, data stores, and data flows of a given system. The assignment also includes a comprehensive written report and diagram visualizations.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate understanding of DFD concepts.
- Develop a clear and accurate DFD for the assigned system.
- Document the analysis process and findings in a report.

## Tools Used
- **Draw.io**: For creating the DFD diagrams.
- **Microsoft Word**: For the written report.
- **Visual Paradigm**: For detailed diagram modeling.

## Repository Structure
- **Instructions.pdf**: Assignment instructions and requirements.
- **Assignment1_DFD.docx**: The written report providing an in-depth analysis of the system, including DFD explanations.
- **DFD_Context.vpd**: Visual Paradigm file for the Context DFD.
- **DFD_Level_0.vpd**: Visual Paradigm file for the Level 0 DFD.
- **DFD_PDFs**: Exported PDFs of the diagrams for easy viewing.

## File Descriptions
1. **`Instructions.pdf`**: Document file containing the assignment prompt and objectives.
2. **`Assignment1_DFD`.docx**: A comprehensive report detailing the system analysis and DFDs.
3. **`DFD_Context.vpd`**: A Visual Paradigm project file for the Context DFD.
4. **`DFD_Level_0.vpd`**: A Visual Paradigm project file for the Level 0 DFD.
5. **`DFD_PDFs/Context.pdf`**: PDF version of the Context DFD for review.
6. **`DFD_PDFs/Level_0.pdf`**: PDF version of the Level 0 DFD for review.

## How to Use
1. View the assignment requirements in `Instructions.pdf`.
2. Open `Assignment1_DFD.docx` for detailed explanations and insights.
3. Use Visual Paradigm to open `.vpd` files for editing or viewing the diagrams.
4. Alternatively, review the `.pdf` versions of the DFDs in the `DFD_PDFs` folder.
